# Tropos incentive testnet rewards final result


### Explaination
TROS/STOS conversion rate is `3.2989` 

1 TROS = 10^9 utros 

1 STOS = 10^18 wei

[tropos_reward_account_balances.json](tropos_reward_account_balances.json) include all rewards from Tropos Incentive testnet converted into Mainnet STOS

[tropos_4_legacy_account_balances.json](tropos_4_legacy_account_balances.json) include all legacy account from Tropos 4  that havenâ€™t finished the migration process for address change from Tropos 4 to Tropos 5. Those rewards will likely be lost after mainnet launch as their wallet will not be correctly recognized.  

#### ps: This is just a reference of final result, all balances will be included in the Straots Chain Mainnet genesis in a proper format.
